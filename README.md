# Module 9 Challenge

In this project we will be presenting information regarding temperature trends for the months of June and december in Oahu to determine the sustainaility of a "Surf and Ice cream Shop".

The new technologies introduced for this data analysis are SQLite and SQLAlchemy.

The project includes an SQLite Database that contains 2 tables: stations and measurements. This database contain weather data and we will focus on temperature.

## Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June

## Results: 

June Temps |   December Temps

- What is very interesting is how similar the mean values for the months of June and December.  In June the mean temperature is 74.94 and in December the mean temeprature is 71.04. Both means are above the 70 degrees F and both are below 75F. The weather is consistent throughout the Summer and winter seasons
- The next value that I would focus is the maximum temperature recorded for the month of June: 85 degrees F while in december the maximum temperature recorded is 83 F. Such similar maximum temperatures also seems to show how conssistent the weather is both in the summer and winter. 
- it is only for the coldest temperature that there is a difference of 9 degrees. In June the minimum temperature is 64F in december the minimum is 56F. This is the first parameter where there is a bigger difference between temperatures.
